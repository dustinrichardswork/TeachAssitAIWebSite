#Slide: 2
#Header: LEARNING AIMS
#Content: By the end of this presentation, you should understand what Redux props are, how they work, and how to use them in a React application.

#Slide: 3
#Header: SUCCESS CRITERIA
#Content: You'll be able to define Redux props, demonstrate how they work with React components, and resolve potential issues that might arise from using Redux props.

#Slide: 4
#Header: Introduction to Redux
#Content: Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you manage the state of your application.

#Slide: 5
#Header: Overview of Props in React
#Content: "Props" is a special keyword in React, standing for properties. They are used for passing data from one component to another.

#Slide: 6
#Header: Connection between Redux and Props
#Content: Redux provides a state to the whole app and any component in the application can access any state property via props.

#Slide: 7
#Header: Working with Redux Props in React - Part 1
#Content: To use Redux props in React, you first import the necessary Redux functions. 

#Slide: 8
#Header: Working with Redux Props in React - Part 2
#Content: Then you define your state and actions in Redux. 

#Slide: 9
#Header: Working with Redux Props in React - Part 3
#Content: You connect Redux to your React component and map the state and actions to props.

#Slide: 10
#Header: Examples
#Content: Now let's look at some examples of using Redux props in a React application. 

#Slide: 11
#Header: Example - Counter App - Part 1
#Content: We will be building a simple counter app which uses Redux props.

#Slide: 12
#Header: Example - Counter App - Part 2
#Content: First, we'll define our Redux state and actions for incrementing and decrementing the counter.

#Slide: 13
#Header: Example - Counter App - Part 3
#Content: Next, we connect Redux to our counter component and map the state and actions to props.

#Slide: 14
#Header: Common Issues
#Content: Common problems include attempting to mutate the state directly, not connecting the Redux store, etc.

#Slide: 15
#Header: Recommendations
#Content: Always plan your state ahead of implementation, avoid mutating state directly, use mapStateToProps() and mapDispatchToProps().

#Slide: 16
#Header: Quick Recap - Part 1
#Content: Redux is a state container. Props are used for passing data. Redux props allow state and actions to be accessed via props.

#Slide: 17
#Header: Quick Recap - Part 2
#Content: Issues can arise from improper uses of Redux and direct state mutation. Good practices can help to avoid these issues.

#Slide: 18
#Header: Summary
#Content: We have learned what Redux props are, and how to use them in a React application. Practice with different apps to solidify your understanding.
