#Header: Introduction
#Content: React Hooks are a new feature added in React 16.8. They allow users to add state and other React features to functional components, providing an improved way to write reusable, readable, and maintainable code.

#Slide: 5
#Header: What are Hooks?
#Content: Hooks are functions that allow you to use React features in functional components. They provide a more flexible and concise alternative to class components, making it easier to reuse logic across different components.

#Slide: 6
#Header: Why use Hooks?
#Content: Hooks offer several benefits such as:
- Simplifying component logic and reducing code complexity
- Making it easier to share stateful logic between components
- Improving performance by reducing unnecessary re-renders
- Enhancing code readability and maintainability

#Slide: 7
#Header: How to use Hooks?
#Content: To use Hooks, you simply import them from the 'react' library. Then, you can use them directly inside your functional components. There are various Hooks available, each serving a different purpose.

#Slide: 8
#Header: useState Hook
#Content: The useState Hook allows you to add state to your functional components. It returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update the state. This allows you to manage state within your components without using a class.

#Slide: 9
#Header: useEffect Hook
#Content: The useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects in your functional components. It takes a function as its first argument and executes that function after the component has rendered. You can use it to fetch data, subscribe to events, or perform any necessary side effects.

#Slide: 10
#Header: Other Hooks
#Content: Apart from useState and useEffect, React provides other built-in Hooks like useContext, useReducer, useCallback, and useMemo. These Hooks serve specific purposes and can be used in various scenarios to enhance the functionality of your components.
