#Slide: 4
#Header: Introduction to Redux
#Content: 
- Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications.
- It helps manage the state of an application in a predictable way.
- Redux follows a single source of truth principle.

#Slide: 5
#Header: Why Use Redux?
#Content: 
- Redux helps manage complex application states.
- It provides a centralized store for all application data.
- Redux improves code organization and maintainability.
- It enables easy debugging and testing.

#Slide: 6
#Header: Redux Concepts
#Content: 
- Actions: describe what happened in the application.
- Reducers: specify how the state changes in response to actions.
- Store: holds the application state and provides methods to interact with it.

#Slide: 7
#Header: How Redux Works
#Content: 
- Actions are dispatched from components.
- Reducers receive the actions and update the state.
- The updated state is stored in a centralized store.
- Components can subscribe to the store to access the state.

#Slide: 8
#Header: Redux in Action
#Content: 
- Demonstrate a practical example of Redux in a React application.
- Show how actions are dispatched and handled by reducers.
- Explain how the state is updated and accessed through the store.

#Slide: 9
#Headers: Summary
#Content: 
- Redux is a powerful state management library for JavaScript applications.
- It helps manage complex application states in a predictable way.
- Redux uses actions, reducers, and a store to update and access the state.
- Understanding Redux is essential for building scalable React applications.
