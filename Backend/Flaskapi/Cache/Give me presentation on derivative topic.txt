#Header: Introduction to Derivatives
#Content: 
- The derivative measures how a function changes when its input changes.
- It provides information about the rate of change or slope of a function at a specific point.
- Derivatives are fundamental in calculus and have wide-ranging applications in many fields.

#Slide: 5
#Header: The Derivative Function
#Content:
- The derivative of a function f(x) is written as f'(x) or dy/dx.
- It represents the rate of change of the function at any given point.
- The derivative function allows us to analyze how the original function behaves.

#Slide: 6
#Header: Calculating Derivatives
#Content:
- To calculate derivatives, we use differentiation techniques such as the power rule, product rule, and chain rule.
- Derivatives can be found for various types of functions, including polynomial, exponential, and trigonometric functions.

#Slide: 7
#Header: Rules of Differentiation
#Content:
- The power rule: The derivative of x^n is n * x^(n-1).
- The product rule: The derivative of the product of two functions is the first function times the derivative of the second plus the second function times the derivative of the first.
- The chain rule: The derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function multiplied by the derivative of the inner function.

#Header: Applications of Derivatives
#Content:
- Optimization: Derivatives help find the maximum or minimum value of a function, which is useful in optimizing processes.
- Rates of Change: Derivatives can measure rates of change in quantities such as velocity, acceleration, and growth rates.
- Slope of Tangent Lines: Derivatives give the slope of a tangent line to a curve at a particular point.
