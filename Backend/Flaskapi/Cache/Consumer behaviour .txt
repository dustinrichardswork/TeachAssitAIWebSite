#Header: Diminishing Marginal Utility Theory
#Content: 
- Diminishing Marginal Utility Theory states that as a person consumes more units of a particular good or service, the additional utility or satisfaction derived from each additional unit decreases.
- This theory helps us understand how consumers allocate their resources to maximize their utility.

#Header: Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility

- According to the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility, the more of a product a consumer consumes, the less satisfaction they derive from each additional unit.
- For example, the first slice of pizza brings great satisfaction, but the tenth slice may not bring the same level of satisfaction.
