#Header: Introduction to Object Detection
#Content: Object detection is a computer vision technology that involves identifying and locating objects in images or videos. It is a fundamental task for many applications, such as autonomous vehicles, surveillance, and image recognition.

#Slide: 5
#Header: How Object Detection Works
#Content: Object detection starts by extracting features from an image or video frame. These features are then used to train a machine learning model. The model is then applied to new images or videos to detect and identify objects based on the learned features.

#Header: Applications of Object Detection
#Content: Object detection has various applications, including:
- Autonomous vehicles: to detect pedestrians, other vehicles, and traffic signs
- Surveillance: to detect and track suspicious activities
- Medical imaging: to detect tumors or anomalies
- Retail: to track inventory or detect shoplifting
- Robotics: to detect and manipulate objects

#Slide: 7
#Header: Challenges in Object Detection
#Content: Object detection faces several challenges, such as:
- Variation in object appearance and shape
- Occlusion of objects
- Changing lighting conditions
- Real-time processing requirements
- Handling large datasets for training

#Slide: 8
#Header: Summary
#Content: Object detection is a computer vision technology used to identify and locate objects in images or videos. It has various applications and involves training a machine learning model with extracted features. However, it also faces challenges such as variation in object appearance and real-time processing requirements.
