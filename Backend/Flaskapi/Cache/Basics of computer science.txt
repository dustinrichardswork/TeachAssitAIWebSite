#Header: Introduction to Computer Science
#Content: Computer science is the study of computers and computational systems. It involves understanding how computers work, solving problems using algorithms, and developing software and hardware solutions.

#Slide: 5
#Header: Algorithms and Problem Solving
#Content: Algorithms are step-by-step instructions for solving a problem. Problem solving involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable tasks and designing algorithms to solve them.

#Slide: 6
#Header: Programming Languages
#Content: Programming languages are used to write instructions that tell computers what to do. There are various languages such as Python, Java, C++, and more, each with its own syntax and purpose.

#Slide: 7
#Header: Data Structures
#Content: Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data to perform efficient operations. Examples include arrays, lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

#Slide: 8
#Header: Computer Systems
#Content: Computer systems consist of hardware and software components. Hardware includes the physical parts like the CPU, memory, and storage, while software refers to the programs that run on the hardware.

#Slide: 9
#Header: Networking and Communication
#Content: Networking and communication involve connecting computers together to share information. This is done through networks, protocols, and communication technologies like the Internet.

#Slide: 10
#Header: Cybersecurity
#Content: Cybersecurity focuses on protecting computer systems and data from unauthorized access, use, or damage. It includes techniques like encryption, firewalls, and user authentication.

#Slide: 11
#Header: Artificial Intelligence
#Content: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science that simulates human intelligence in machines. It includes areas like machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision.

#Slide: 12
#Header: Big Data and Data Analytics
#Content: Big data refers to large and complex datasets, and data analytics is the process of extracting insights from these datasets. This helps in making informed decisions and predictions.

#Slide: 13
#Header: Web Development
#Content: Web development involves designing and building websites using programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes front-end development, back-end development, and web frameworks.
