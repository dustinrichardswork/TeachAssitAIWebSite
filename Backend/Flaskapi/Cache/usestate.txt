#Slide: 4
#Header: What is useState?
#Content: 
- useState is a built-in hook in React that allows functional components to have state.
- State represents the data that a component needs to keep track of and potentially update.
- useState returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update it.

#Slide: 5
#Header: Syntax of useState
#Content: 
- Syntax: const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)
- state: current value of the state
- setState: function to update the state
- initialState: optional initial value for the state

#Slide: 6
#Header: Examples of useState
#Content: 
- Example 1: const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
- Example 2: const [name, setName] = useState("")

#Slide: 7
#Header: Updating State
#Content: 
- To update the state, we call the setState function and pass in the new value.
- Example: setCount(count + 1);

#Slide: 8
#Header: Setting Initial State
#Content: 
- We can set an initial state value by passing it as an argument to useState.
- Example: const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

#Slide: 9
#Header: Multiple useState Hooks
#Content: 
- We can have multiple useState hooks in a single component to manage different pieces of state.
- Example: const [count, setCount] = useState(0); 
           const [name, setName] = useState("");

#Slide: 10
#Header: Key Points to Remember
#Content: 
- useState is used to manage state in functional components.
- Syntax: const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)
- State can be updated using the setState function.
- Initial state can be set by passing it as an argument to useState.
- Multiple useState hooks can be used in a single component.

#Slide: 11
#Header: Exercise: Implementing useState
#Content: 
- Implement a simple counter using useState.
- Set the initial value to 0.
- Display the current count on the screen.
- Add buttons to increment and decrement the count.

#Slide: 12
#Header: Exercise: Updating State
#Content: 
- Modify the previous exercise to update the count by 5 instead of 1 when the increment button is clicked.

#Slide: 13
#Header: Exercise: Setting Initial State
#Content: 
- Modify the previous exercise to set the initial count value to 10 instead of 0.

#Slide: 14
#Header: Exercise: Multiple useState Hooks
#Content: 
- Create a form with two input fields: name and email.
- Use useState to manage the state of both input fields.
- Display the current values of the input fields on the screen.

#Slide: 15
#Header: Summary
#Content: 
- useState is a powerful hook in React for managing state in functional components.
- It allows us to easily create and update state in a concise syntax.
- By using useState, we can make our components more dynamic and interactive.
