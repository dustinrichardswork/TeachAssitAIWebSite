#Slide: 4
#Header: Introduction to Props State
#Content: 
- Props and state are important concepts in React for managing data in components
- They allow data to be passed from parent to child components (props) or stored and managed within a component (state)
- Props and state enable dynamic and interactive components in React applications

#Slide: 5
#Header: Definition and Purpose
#Content: 
- Props (short for properties) are read-only data passed from a parent component to a child component
- State is mutable data that is stored and managed within a component
- Props are used for passing data and event handlers down the component tree
- State is used for managing the internal data and re-rendering the component when it changes

#Slide: 6
#Header: Syntax and Usage
#Content: 
- Props are passed to child components as attributes in JSX
- Child components access props using the `props` object, e.g., `this.props`
- State is initialized in the constructor of a class component using `this.state = { }`
- State can be updated using the `setState` method, triggering a re-render of the component

#Slide: 7
#Header: Example 1: Using Props
#Content: 
- Demonstrate how to pass props from a parent component to a child component
- Explain how the child component can access and use the props passed to it
- Show a code example of a parent component passing props and a child component using them

#Slide: 8
#Header: Example 2: Using State
#Content: 
- Show how to initialize state in a class component and update it using `setState`
- Explain how the component automatically re-renders when the state changes
- Provide a code example of a class component using state and updating it with an event handler

#Slide: 9
#Header: Pros and Cons
#Content: 
- Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using props and state in React applications
- Highlight the flexibility and reusability of components with props
- Mention the complexity and potential performance issues of managing state in larger applications

#Slide: 10
#Header: Best Practices
#Content: 
- Provide guidelines for using props and state effectively in React applications
- Encourage minimizing the usage of state and lifting it up to higher-level parent components when possible
- Emphasize the importance of immutability when updating state to avoid bugs
- Suggest using prop types or TypeScript for type-checking when working with props

#Slide: 11
#Header: Summary
#Content: 
- Props and state are key concepts in React for managing data in components
- Props are read-only data passed from parent to child components
- State is mutable data stored and managed within a component
- Understanding and using props and state effectively is crucial for building dynamic and interactive React applications.
