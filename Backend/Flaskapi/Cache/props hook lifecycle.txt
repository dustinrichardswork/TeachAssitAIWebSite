- Understand the concept of props in React
- Explore the different hooks available in React
- Learn how to use each hook effectively
- Gain knowledge on when and where to use specific hooks
- Apply the knowledge to create a functional and efficient component using props and hooks.

#Slide: 3
#Header: Success Criteria
#Content: 
By the end of this presentation, you will be able to:
- Explain the concept of props in React
- Identify and describe the purpose of each hook
- Use the useState hook to manage state in functional components
- Utilize the useEffect hook to implement side effects
- Apply the useLayoutEffect hook for layout-specific effects
- Understand the need for useMemo and useCallback hooks for performance optimization
- Demonstrate the use of the useRef hook to reference elements
- Utilize the useContext hook for accessing shared information
- Create custom hooks for reuse
- Apply the learned concepts to build a functional component using props and hooks.

#Header: Props in React
#Content: 
- Props are short for properties and are used to pass data from one component to another in React.
- Props are read-only and should not be modified directly within the component.
- Each component has their own props received from the parent component, defining the component's behavior.

#Slide: 5
#Header: What is the Hook?
#Content: 
- Hooks are functions that allow you to use React features in functional components.
- Introduced in React 16.8, Hooks provide an alternative to writing class components for managing state and side effects.
- They are essential for developing complex and reusable logic within functional components.

#Slide: 6
#Header: useState Hook
#Content: 
- useState is a hook used for managing state in functional components.
- It takes an initial value and returns an array with the current state and a function to update the state.
- Example usage: const [count, setCount] = useState(0); where count is the current state and setCount is the function to update it.

#Slide: 7
#Header: useEffect Hook
#Content:
- useEffect is a hook used for implementing side effects in functional components.
- It runs after rendering and allows performing tasks like data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.
- Example usage: useEffect(() => { /* side effect code */ }, [dependency]); where the dependency array specifies when to run the effect.

#Slide: 8
#Header: useLayoutEffect Hook
#Content:
- useLayoutEffect is similar to useEffect, but it runs synchronously after all DOM mutations.
- It is useful for performing DOM mutations or measurements before the browser repaints.
- Example usage: useLayoutEffect(() => { /* layout effect code */ }, [dependency]);

#Slide: 9
#Header: useMemo Hook
#Content:
- useMemo is a hook used for performance optimization by memoizing expensive calculations.
- It ensures that the calculations are only performed when the dependencies change.
- Example usage: const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => calculateExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);

#Slide: 10
#Header: useCallback Hook
#Content:
- useCallback is a hook used for performance optimization by memoizing functions.
- It returns a memoized version of the callback function that only changes if the dependencies change.
- Example usage: const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => { /* callback implementation */ }, [dependency]);

#Slide: 11
#Header: useRef Hook
#Content:
- useRef is a hook used for accessing and storing mutable values that persist across renders.
- It returns a mutable ref object that can hold any value.
- Example usage: const ref = useRef(initialValue);

#Slide: 12
#Header: useContext Hook
#Content:
- useContext is a hook used for accessing values from a React context.
- It allows accessing shared information without the need for prop drilling.
- Example usage: const value = useContext(MyContext);

#Slide: 13
#Header: Custom Hooks
#Content:
- Custom Hooks are functions that use other hooks and provide a specific functionality.
- They allow the reuse of common stateful or reusable logic across different components.
- Example usage: function useCustomHook() { /* custom hook implementation */ }

#Slide: 14
#Header: Example: Using Props and Hooks
#Content:
- Show an example of a functional component using props to receive data and different hooks to manage state and perform side effects.
- Explain how the props are passed down from the parent component and utilized within the functional component using various hooks.

#Slide: 15
#Header: Tips and Best Practices
#Content:
- Provide best practices for using props and hooks effectively:
  - Keep components small and focused.
  - Use props to pass data and hooks to manage state.
  - Use the appropriate hook for the desired functionality.
  - Avoid unnecessary re-renders with useMemo and useCallback.
  - Utilize the useRef hook for accessing DOM elements.
  - Use useContext to access shared data.
  - Follow naming conventions and code readability guidelines.

#Slide: 16
#Header: Summary
#Content:
- Recap the main points discussed in the presentation:
  - Props in React: pass data from one component to another.
  - Hooks in React: functions for adding features to functional components.
  - Various hooks available: useState, useEffect, useLayoutEffect, useMemo, useCallback, useRef, useContext.
  - Custom hooks: allow for reusable and stateful logic across components.
  - Best practices: keep components small, use appropriate hooks, optimize performance with useMemo and useCallback.
