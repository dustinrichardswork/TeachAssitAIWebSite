#Slide: 4
#Header: Introduction to State Management
#Content: State management refers to the process of managing the application's state, which includes handling data and its changes throughout the application. In React, state management is essential for building complex and interactive applications.

#Slide: 5
#Header: Local State vs. Global State
#Content: Local state is specific to a component and can only be accessed within that component, while global state can be accessed and modified by multiple components. Local state is suitable for simple applications, while global state is ideal for larger and more complex applications.

#Header: Popular State Management Libraries
#Content: Some popular state management libraries used in React include:
1. Redux: A predictable state container for JavaScript applications.
2. MobX: A simple, scalable state management solution using direct observables.
3. Recoil: An experimental state management library designed for React.
4. Zustand: A small, fast, and flexible state management solution.
