#Slide: 4
#Header: Introduction to React
#Content: React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update them based on changes in data.

#Slide: 5
#Header: React Components
#Content: React components are the building blocks of a React application. They encapsulate both the appearance and behavior of a specific part of the user interface.

#Slide: 6
#Header: JSX - JavaScript XML
#Content: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. It helps to create React elements easily and efficiently.

#Slide: 7
#Header: State and Props
#Content: State and props are two important concepts in React. State represents the internal data of a component, whereas props are used to pass data from a parent component to its children.

#Slide: 8
#Header: React Lifecycle Methods
#Content: React provides a set of lifecycle methods that allow you to control how components behave at different stages of their lifecycle, such as initialization, rendering, updating, and unmounting.

#Slide: 9
#Header: Handling Events in React
#Content: React provides a simple yet powerful way to handle events within components. You can attach event handlers to specific elements and define custom functions to handle those events.

#Slide: 10
#Header: React Forms
#Content: Building forms in React involves managing the state of form inputs and handling user input. React provides various techniques to simplify form handling and validation.

#Slide: END
#Header: Summary
#Content: In this presentation, we covered the basics of React, including components, JSX, state and props, lifecycle methods, event handling, forms, React Router, and React Hooks. With this knowledge, you are now equipped to start building interactive web applications using React. Happy coding!
