#Header: Introduction to Derivation
#Content: 
- Derivation is a fundamental concept in calculus.
- It allows us to find the rate of change of a function at any given point.
- Derivatives have numerous applications in various fields.

#Slide: 5
#Header: Definition of Derivative
#Content: 
- The derivative of a function represents its instantaneous rate of change at any given point.
- It is defined as the limit of the difference quotient as the interval approaches zero.

#Slide: 6
#Header: Notation and Terminology
#Content: 
- The derivative of a function f(x) is denoted by f'(x) or dy/dx.
- The derivative can also be written as df(x)/dx or d/dx[f(x)].

#Slide: 7
#Header: Rules of Differentiation
#Content: 
- The power rule, product rule, quotient rule, and chain rule are used to differentiate functions.
- These rules enable us to find the derivative of more complex functions.

#Slide: 8
#Header: Applications of Derivation
#Content: 
- Derivatives have applications in physics, economics, engineering, and more.
- They help us analyze rates of change, motion, optimization, and graph properties, among others.

#Slide: 9
#Header: Higher Order Derivatives
#Content: 
- Higher order derivatives represent the derivative of a derivative.
- Differentiation can be applied repeatedly to find second, third, and higher order derivatives.

#Slide: 10
#Header: Differentiation Techniques
#Content: 
- In addition to the basic rules, advanced techniques like implicit differentiation and logarithmic differentiation are used.
- These techniques are applied when functions are not easily differentiable using standard rules.

#Slide: 11
#Header: Implicit Differentiation
#Content: 
- Implicit differentiation is used when the given equation cannot be easily solved for y.
- It involves differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to x, treating y as an implicit function of x.

#Slide: 12
#Header: Summary
#Content: 
- Derivatives represent the rate of change or slope of a function.
- Differentiation involves finding derivatives of functions using rules and techniques.
- Derivatives have applications in various fields, including related rates and optimization.
- Higher order derivatives represent derivatives of derivatives.
- Implicit differentiation is used when the equation cannot be solved for y explicitly.
